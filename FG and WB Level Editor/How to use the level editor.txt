HOW TO USE LEVEL EDITOR
1. Obstacles now work, I have a clue how to code it so they all work together, only manually program laser size for obstacles
	(obstacles are buttons, switches and lasers)
2. New will create a new blank map where load will load the map from the "LevelX.lvl" file (feel free to change this file to any thing
	you want just make sure it is called LevelX.lvl to load it properly.
3. You can edit the level by clicking and dragging a tile to where you want it to go. NOTE: obstacles do work, this is intended.
4. If you want to edit the portions of the level under the tile select pane, press the space bar or the enter key to close it. Pressing
	these keys again will open up the tile select pane again.
5. To delete a tile, right click over it and it will go away.
6. In order for obstacles to be made properly, you must connect them.  To do this press the "c" key and follow the on screen instructions.
	If for some reason you want to end this holy experience, press c again.
7. When you are done and want to save, press Ctrl+S to save (nothing will visibly be different) and the LevelX.lvl file will be saved
	and ready to be read by the main game (Don't forget to rename the file to which level you need and to connect obstacles!)

ENJOY!
